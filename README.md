- 👋 Hi, I’m Mahdi Mohseni, an assistant professor at Qom University of Technology in Qom, Iran.
- 👀 I’m interested in turbulence modeling and turbulent flows. I am also interested in energy-related fluid systems.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to model turbulent flows using machine learning, parallel processing on the GPU, and simulating using OpenFOAM.
- 💞️ I'm looking for a collaboration in the modelling of turbulent flows and turbulence modelling with or without machine learning as well as in energy related fluid systems.
- 📫 How to reach me : m_mohseni.kntu@yahoo.com
